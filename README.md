### S.I.R.I.U.S

Is mostly based on supervised/semi supervised learning, in order to find a point where it is low entropy in output. in other words it is purposefully designed and meant for research around open source models. 

## Purpose
Unrelated but will be introduced to this project is, datasets in terms of quality. This will pertain to a specific case where i only work on having it do one specific task, not mulit-modal inference, just pure datasets,probability & statistics.

# NOTE:
This is not meant as a service or product, as it constitutes research and understanding of what is and what isnt useful / quality data. furthermore feel free to fork!
